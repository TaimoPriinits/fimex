/**
 * The FillWriter will insert the data from the reader to an existing file. This is useful
 * when combining NWP model output, coming slice by slice (e.g. timestep or level), into one
 * large file. In contrast to NCO's ncrcat http://nco.sourceforge.net/nco.html#Concatenation
 * the FillWriter will not append the data at the end of the unlimited-dimension, but
 * will check the dimension's values and put the data to the right position.
 *
 * The output-file should contain already all dimensions in the right size and with the
 * right dimension-values, e.g. created by ncgen or similar.
 *
 * The FillWriter will not try to write new variables. It might try to append new
 * dimension-values to the end of exiting dimensions if allowed by the CDMReaderWriter.
 *
 * No attributes are changed in the output-file.
